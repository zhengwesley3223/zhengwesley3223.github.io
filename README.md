# Project Description
The project that I plan on doing is a youtube collaboration queue project. This project will allow users to watch and queue youtube videos together. There will be commands that will allow users to add a youtube video to the queue, skip a video by majority vote and more. I will also be trying to implement a chatroom with the videos so that people can watch and discuss the videos in real time.

# Project Design
SpringMVC will be one of the main technologies being used. Another would be the Apache Tomcat server. I will also be using Git Bash for
Unix Shell and command language. Main API being used would be the Youtube API. The project will also be implementing MongoDB or SQL. Maven will also be used in the making of the project. I will also be implementing the IRC for the chatroom function. If that does not work out maybe, using the Discord API or Slack API to do it. The list of technologies can still be changed based on future challenges or problems.

# Project Justification
The novelty of my program/application is to create like a theater for friends and groups. In this day and age, people make friends from all over the country or world. So by using this application, the people can watch and discuss videos in real time. There is a similar applicaiton out there called "Rabb.it" but that requires the people to share control over a virtual machine. Mine will allow everyone in the room to queue and make decisions on the videos. This is a great learning experience for me. I will be using different APIs and getting them to work together by using the information that I have learned in this class.
