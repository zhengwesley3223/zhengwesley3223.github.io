Project Description
The project that I plan on doing is a chat room project. This will allow people to chat in real time with each other.
The chat room should allow users to join different group/chat. This way people are not limited to just one group and
can chat with people in different groups.

# Project Design
SpringMVC will be one of the main technologies being used. Another would be the Apache Tomcat server. I will also be using Git Bash for
Unix Shell and command language. Main API being used would be the Discord API or Slack API. The project will also be implementing MongoDB or SQL. Maven will also be used in the making of the project. The list of technologies can still be changed based on future challenges or problems.

# Use Cases
Use Case 1: Send message \n
Use Case 2: Send image/file \n
Use Case 3: Create groups \n
Use Case 4: View users in a group \n

# Project Justification
There is no real novelty to my program. However, chat room is something that is widely used on the Internet. I believe that by 
attempting this project, will give me a better understanding of JAVA and the different codes. This would be a great learning experience, which, can be used in the future. I believe that making a chat room is no easy task and that it requires some knowledge on how it works. Through working on this project, I will be able to apply my knowledge and gain new knowledge in the process.
